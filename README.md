# Reverb algorithms

<<<<<<< HEAD
Studies on classic reverb algorithms, including: Shcroeder, Moorer, Gardner. Also my own implementation with spatialization of sound features.

Some studies on acoustics I did as part of my thesis _"Localization of sound objects in virtual acoustics"_.
It includes classic reverb algorithms (Schroeder, Moorer and Gardner)[^1][^2][^3], as well as my final work implementing spatialization of sound in `reverberator.m`.
